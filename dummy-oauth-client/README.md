Inspired from the following project 

https://github.com/Baeldung/spring-security-oauth

A simple Angular client for Authorization Code Flow

## Run the Module
To run the application, first make sure both authorization and resource server are already running
Then, build the app using command line:

```

Change directory to src/main/resources:
```
cd src/main/resources
```

Finally, run the app on port 8089:
```
